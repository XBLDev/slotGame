Issues(8/06/2017):

1. The OOP implementation is not "strict" enough, at least some of the classes can be smaller/split into more classes.
2. On Android, it won't react to touch, and the image I use for ACE won't show.
3. I run out of time so I didn't do the sound on click/win part.
4. Should put some comments in my code.
5. Some game functions are rather simple implementations rather than well made functions/algorithms, due to time limit.

Issues(6/06/2017):

1. I've been just rushing to get PixiJS working since i've never used it before, so no time
to split the whole thing into classes yet. And no time to clean up the code.
2. UI positions are all hard-coded.
3. I don't know how to put it on android yet, looked around but didn't find easy-to-use mannual on that. 
It's supposed to be easy enough though.
4. Don't know how far I can get with "strict OOP", not really sure how "strict" is strict
5. Game logic could be flawed since I don't know much about slot games.
